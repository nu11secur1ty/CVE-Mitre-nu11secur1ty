![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/kopage.com/Kopage-Website-Builder-4.4.15/docs/Screenshot%202023-12-08%20101607.png)

## Description:
The file upload function suffers from file upload vulnerability, there is no strong sanitizing function for uploading some extension files.
In this case, I uploaded an HTML web socket client on their server and then I connected this client with my javascript server =)
Depending on the scenario, this can be the end of privacy and even worse than ever!
I am a Penetration Tester, not a stupid cracker! Thank you all!
