## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 12/08/2023
## Vendor: https://www.kopage.com/
## Software: https://demo.kopage.com/index.php
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload, https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload

## Description:
The file upload function suffers from file upload vulnerability, there is no strong sanitizing function for uploading some extension files.
In this case, I uploaded an HTML web socket client on their server and then I connected this client with my javascript server =)
Depending on the scenario, this can be the end of privacy and even worse than ever!
I am a Penetration Tester, not a stupid cracker! Thank you all!
