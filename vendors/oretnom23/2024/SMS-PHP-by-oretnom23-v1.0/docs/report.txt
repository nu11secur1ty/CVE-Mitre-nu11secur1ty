## Date: 01/15/2024
## Vendor: https://github.com/oretnom23
## Software: https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/2024/SMS-PHP-by-oretnom23-v1.0/docs/sms.zip
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `username` and `password` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payloads 50234125' or 1478=1478-- and 80378308' or 3393=3397-- were each submitted in the username parameter. These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way. The second way is bypassing of login
by using SQLi bypass authentication vulnerability. The attacker can destroy this system by using these vulnerabilities!
