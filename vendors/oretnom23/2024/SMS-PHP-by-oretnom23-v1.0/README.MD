### [SMS-PHP-by-oretnom23-v1.0 Multiple-SQLi](https://github.com/oretnom23)

![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/2024/SMS-PHP-by-oretnom23-v1.0/docs/Screenshot%202024-01-15%20152732.png)


## Description:
The `username` and `password` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payloads 50234125' or 1478=1478-- and 80378308' or 3393=3397-- were each submitted in the username parameter. These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way. The second way is bypassing of login
by using SQLi bypass authentication vulnerability. The attacker can destroy this system by using these vulnerabilities!
