## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `id` parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A single quote was submitted in the id parameter, and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. You should review the contents of the error message, and the application's handling of other input, to confirm whether a vulnerability is present. The attacker can get all sensitive information from this system when he attacks it online!
