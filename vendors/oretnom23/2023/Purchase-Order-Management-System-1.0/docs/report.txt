## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection


## Description:
The username parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A single quote was submitted in the username parameter, and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. The attacker can easily steal all information from the database of this 
application.
