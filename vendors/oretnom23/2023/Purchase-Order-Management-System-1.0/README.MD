### [Purchase-Order-Management-System-1.0 Multiple-SQLi](https://github.com/oretnom23)

![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/2023/Purchase-Order-Management-System-1.0/docs/Screenshot%202023-12-14%20103819.png)

## Description:
The username parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A single quote was submitted in the username parameter, and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. The attacker can easily steal all information from the database of this 
application.
