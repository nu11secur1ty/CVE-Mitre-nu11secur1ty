## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 06.14.2023
## Vendor: https://github.com/oretnom23
## Software: https://github.com/oretnom23/php-elearning-system
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The username parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payloads 73152795' or 7515=7515-- and 13684562' or 3996=3998-- were each submitted in the username parameter. These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way. The attacker can easily steal all information from the database of this system.
