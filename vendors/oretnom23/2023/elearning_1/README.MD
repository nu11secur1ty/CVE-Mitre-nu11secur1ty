![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/2023/elearning_1/docs/Screenshot%202023-06-14%20184607.png)

## Description:
The username parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payloads 73152795' or 7515=7515-- and 13684562' or 3996=3998-- were each submitted in the username parameter. These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way. The attacker can easily steal all information from the database of this system.
