## Description:
The parameter "fileupload" in type ID is vulnerable to File Upload and RCE attacks, it is not sanitized correctly.
The attacker can upload a virus directly on the server by using this web vulnerability, and then he can execute it, this can be 
the end of this server it depending on the scenario! In this case, I just uploaded a websocket connector - exploit.html to connect the server with my machine, this is so nasty.
I am a Penetration Tester, not a stupid cracker! Thank you all!
