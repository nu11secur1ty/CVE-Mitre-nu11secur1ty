## Description:
The attacker who already has an account can upload a fake module to the system and can execute the content from this module
on the server. In this example, the attacker executes an info file from the already fake uploaded module and gets all information for this system. This is a CRITICAL Vulnerability.
The problem is that these developers are not making a strong sanitizing upload function and do not restrict the execution from inside 
of the server. 

## Staus: HIGH Vulnerability
