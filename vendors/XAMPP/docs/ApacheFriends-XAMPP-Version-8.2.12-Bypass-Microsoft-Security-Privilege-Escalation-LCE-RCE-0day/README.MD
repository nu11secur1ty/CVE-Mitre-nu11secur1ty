## Description:
A successful attack can be possible when the attacker is hacking the XAMPP Windows web server, or he can find a way to upload the exploit on the server of the victim. The next scenario is the attacker must find a weak sanitizing function to upload the malicious PHP exploit and exploit this vulnerability.  The local attack is easier than ever and ABSOLUTELY - DANGEROUS. The normal - administrator user can get a system privilege and can inject every DLL library, he can steal all information of the users of this system, and, etc.
